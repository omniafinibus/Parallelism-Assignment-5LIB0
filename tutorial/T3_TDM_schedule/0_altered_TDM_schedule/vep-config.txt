##
## memory and stack allocation for each partition
## - on each tile the system application takes the first 32 KiB
## - allocate 16, 32, or 64KiB per partition, with a max of 128KiB per tile
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 32KiB
on tile 0 partition 2 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 64KiB
on tile 0 partition 3 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 96KiB
on tile 1 partition 1 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 32KiB
on tile 1 partition 2 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 64KiB
on tile 1 partition 3 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 96KiB
on tile 2 partition 1 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 32KiB
on tile 2 partition 2 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 64KiB
on tile 2 partition 3 has 8KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 96KiB
##
## shared memory allocation for this vep
## - the starting addresses are relative to the start of the shared memory
## - you can use decimal or hex, KiB=1024
## - size & address must use the same format (hex/dec)
## - use /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-size [-A] *.elf
##   in the partition directory to analyse its memory usage
## - use shared_memories/vep_shared_memory_regions.h to manage shared memories
##
#on tile 0 partition 2 shares 1KiB private memory
#in shared memory memshared0 shares 2KiB private memory starting at 125KiB
##
## schedule partitions that have a memory allocation
## - the slot table length must be the same for all slots on a processor
## - max 32 slots per tile
## - a partition can have more than one slot
## - slots are separated by VKERNEL slots of 2000 cycles
## - system partition uses cycles 0-4999; hence first user slot starts at 7000
##
on tile 0 partition 1 has 10100 cycles of 43600 starting at  7000
on tile 0 partition 2 has 10200 cycles of 43600 starting at 19100
on tile 0 partition 3 has 10300 cycles of 43600 starting at 31300
on tile 1 partition 1 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at  7000
on tile 1 partition 2 has 10000 cycles of 43600 starting at 19000
on tile 1 partition 3 has 10600 cycles of 43600 starting at 31000
on tile 2 partition 1 has 10000 cycles of 43000 starting at  7000
on tile 2 partition 2 has 10000 cycles of 43000 starting at 19000
on tile 2 partition 3 has 10000 cycles of 43000 starting at 31000
